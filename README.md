# Welcome to this GitHub project!

Initially, this project will focus on solving the famous Mastermind problem using an approach based on genetic algorithms. Next, attention turns to solving the Traveller's Problem (TSP), again exploiting the capabilities of genetic algorithms, while retaining as far as possible the key elements of the first program developed.

Finally, a crucial step is to generalize the code developed, in order to create a common base capable of solving a wide range of optimization problems.

# Code recovery

You can recover source code by cloning it!

:bulb: Cloning a Git repository from GitHub provides a complete local copy of the source code and associated change history. 

### 1. Install Git

If you haven't already done so, you need to install Git on your computer.


You can download it from the official Git website and follow the installation instructions : https://git-scm.com/

### 2. 

&#8594; <span style="color:green;">Once Git has been installed, open a terminal or command prompt on your computer.</span>

&#8594; <span style="color:green;">Use the *cd* command to navigate to the directory where you wish to clone the repository :</span>

```bash
  cd [link to the folder where the cloned code will be stored]
```
&#8594; <span style="color:green;">Use the following git clone command followed by the repository URL :</span>

```bash
  git clone https://github.com/DAIPA-99/GA_ASSELE_DAIPA.git
```

# So, how does it work?

## Solving the Mastermind problem with a genetic algorithm :
In this section, we implement a genetic algorithm to solve the Mastermind logic game, where you have to guess a secret color combination.



## Solving the traveling salesman problem (TSP) with a genetic algorithm:
Here, we've adapted the previously coded genetic algorithm to solve the famous Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP), where the objective is to find the shortest path through a set of cities only once.

## Generalizing code to solve different problems :
Finally, we generalized our code to solve different optimization problems.
